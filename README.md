# Weather Bot:
 This bot is more a proof-of-concept for the https://open-meteo.com/en/ and geopy.
 The code is FAR from good but it was not the primary concern of mine.

# How to run me:
 Go to bot.py and add your token. You need the newest version of d.py. You might also need to install geopy and aiohttp (pip installation)


# Plans:
 The fact that this bot was a success has lead me to decide to make an api wrapper for the open-meteo api (I am working on it)
